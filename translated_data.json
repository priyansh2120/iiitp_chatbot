Eclectic comprises a diverse group of students from different backgrounds who share a common love for language and literature, and a desire to improve themselves.\nWhen it comes to trying new things, we never back down! Our club began a podcast series, titled \"Yours, Clueless,\" wherein college students who are clueless about what life is like beyond college, could learn about it from their seniors. We invite seniors who have worked in various fields to share their experiences and provide guidance, via a one-on-one interaction between a senior and a junior.\nIn 2022, we held a competition called ‘Eloquence’ with the theme: \"What if you were a TEDx speaker”. Former TEDx speakers were invited to assess the contestants and share their insights. Our members had a wonderful time organising and hosting the event.\nWe conducted a formal debate session at our freshmen auditions for the batch of 2026, and it got pretty intense quite soon! It was encouraging to see so many new members participate and voice their opinions. We think debates are a great way to develop our critical thinking abilities and learn how to communicate our ideas effectively. With new recruits bringing in fresh zest and enthusiasm, all our original members were very eager to engage and organize various activity sessions for them!\nWhen we call ourselves a ‘Literary Club’, it’ll be a grave injustice if we didn’t have a dedicated community for readers! And hence, an internal Book Society was recently founded by Eclectic, where readers come together to read new books, put forth their reviews and perspectives, and engage in wholesome discussion (without spoilers, of course!).\nWith an energetic group of individuals; our biggest goal is to make Eclectic a supportive community, where everyone progresses through engagement and expression!\nत्वरित संपर्क\nहमसे संपर्क करें\nआईआईआईटी पुणे\nUnique Visitors:\n452010\nNUMBER OF HITS:\n3576527\nकॉपीराइट © २०१८ - सर्वाधिकार सुरक्षित - आईआईआईटी पुणे```"
